    "Introducing the new 100% Stacked Area Chart, now available in our core visuals gallery. These visuals display the relative percentage of multiple data series in stacked areas, where the total always equals 100%. It’s perfect for showing the proportion of individual series to the whole and how they change over time. Find it in the visual gallery, on-object dialog, or format pane, right next to the Stacked Area Chart. Give it a try and share your feedback with us!\n",

    "## Enhance Q&A with Copilot-generated Linguistic Relationships\n",
    "-----------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Improving your linguistic schema is an important step in making sure that the Q&A visual can understand the wide range of questions people might ask about their data. This is why, [back in September](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/blog/power-bi-september-2023-feature-summary/#post-24646-_Toc145515965), we added a new section into the Q&A setup menu to help you add linguistic relationships to teach Q&A about words which qualify or relate your data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "But we also know that coming up with all the different words people might be using to refer to your data can take time and effort, and we’ve been working on ways to make that process easier for you! In [November](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/blog/power-bi-november-2023-feature-summary/#post-25061-_Toc150157942), we introduced a way for you to quickly generate new synonyms for the names of tables and columns in your model; this month, we’ve introduced the same functionality for linguistic relationships!  \n",
    "\n",
    "When you open a report with a Q&A visual, if you have Copilot enabled and you’ve already added synonyms, you’ll now see a banner prompting you to get relationships with Copilot as well.  \n",
    "\n",
    "![Image 3: A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](https://dataplatformblogcdn.azureedge.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/a-screenshot-of-a-computer-description-automatica-50.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike with synonyms, Copilot generated relationships will not be used to understand natural language inputs until you have approved them, so make sure you accept the ones which work for your model!  \n",
    "\n",
    "Allow Copilot to help interpret Q&A questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also now use Copilot to improve the Q&A engine’s term recognition when you ask questions! This new feature will trigger when you ask Q&A a question which uses words or phrases which Q&A doesn’t recognize, but which it detects might be referring to data entities like tables or columns. Then, Copilot will also check those unknown words or phrases to see if there is any reasonable match and if so, return the answer as a visual as though a suggested synonym had been applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Image 4: A screenshot of a graph Description automatically generated](https://dataplatformblogcdn.azureedge.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/a-screenshot-of-a-graph-description-automatically-2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This feature is not a replacement for synonyms! In fact, adding synonyms for the entities in your semantic model is even more important to create good matches, as they increase the surface area to check for similarities. It will widen the range of inputs Q&A will recognize, but like a multiplier, it will improve recognition for well modeled data much better than it will for poorly modeled data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This feature will be automatically enabled when you choose to get synonyms with Copilot, but you can also turn it on or off manually in the suggestion settings menu in the Synonyms tab in Q&A setup. \n",

    "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ve made saving Power BI content as an image more simple and more powerful. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, we’ve added a new dropdown menu to the add-in’s footer. In that menu, you can choose whether you want to see live data or a snapshot. So now it is much easier to find where to switch between live data and a static image.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, for snapshots, you now have two options:\n",
    "\n",
    "Public snapshot: Anyone who can view the presentation can view the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "Snapshot: Only those who have permission to view the report in Power BI will be able to see the snapshot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Third, we’ve disabled the default snapshot, so that the slide thumbnail doesn’t show the image by default (this also applies when you copy & paste the slide into an email for example), but only after the add-in is loaded and the required permissions have been checked.\n",
    "\n",
    "And lastly, we honor this setting when you open the presentation in PowerPoint for the web. You still cannot change a live view into a snapshot in PowerPoint for the web, but if you or someone else has changed the view to snapshot in the PowerPoint desktop app, this will be respected, and you will see the snapshot also in PowerPoint for the web.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Storytelling in PowerPoint – Continuous slide show auto refresh\n",
    "---------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "PowerPoint allows you to continuously playback a presentation. This is especially useful when you want to present information in public displays without any human interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a presentation that is running continuously has slides that include the Power BI add-in, the data in the add-in might become outdated, since the add-in gets the data from Power BI when the slide is loaded, or when the user manually refreshes the data being presented.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the new automatic refresh in slide show feature, you can set the add-in to automatically pull fresh data from Power BI while the presentation is in slide show mode, ensuring that the presentation will always show the most recent data.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Image 7: A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](https://dataplatformblogcdn.azureedge.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/a-screenshot-of-a-computer-description-automatica-52.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable automatic refresh, go to the add-in footer, select Add-in options, choose Slide show settings, check Automatic refresh in slide show and set the desired frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that auto refresh only happens in slide show mode and not while you’re editing the presentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Storytelling in PowerPoint – Auto populating the slide title\n",
    "------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "When you add the Power BI add-in to an empty slide that doesn’t have a title yet, the Power BI add-in is here to help. It offers you suggestions for the slide title based on the content of you add-in. The title can be the report name, the page/visual name, or both. Just select the desired option and hit Add title.\n",

    "## Introducing the Fabric metadata scanning sample app\n",
    "---------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "We’re delighted to announce the availability of the new Fabric metadata scanning app. This sample application builds upon the metadata scanning capabilities of Fabric’s set of Admin REST APIs collectively known as the scanner APIs. This new app can be used as a reference for admins interested in utilizing the [Scanner API](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/governance/metadata-scanning-overview) to catalog and report on all the metadata of their organization’s Fabric items.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Fabric metadata scanning sample app handles all the steps for calling the scanner API including authentication, parallelism, throttling, and incremental scanning. In addition, it provides a central configuration file which can be easily modified to suit the specific needs of the caller. Currently authentication is supported both by using a service principal and a delegated token.\n",

    "We’re pleased to announce that you can now send dynamic per recipient subscriptions to up to 1000 recipients instead of the earlier limit of 50 recipients from the data in the Power BI semantic model. For existing subscriptions, we will automatically send subscriptions up to 1000 recipients if your Power BI semantic model contains that many rows of data. You need to edit the subscription if you don’t want to automatically send subscriptions. Learn more about creating dynamic per recipient subscriptions for [Power BI Reports](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-bi/collaborate-share/power-bi-dynamic-report-subscriptions) and [paginated reports](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-bi/collaborate-share/dynamic-subscriptions).\n",

    "Private Links enable secure connectivity to Fabric by restricting access to your Fabric tenant from an Azure VNet of your choice and blocking all public access. This ensures that only network traffic from that VNet is allowed to access Fabric experiences like Notebooks, Lakehouses, Warehouses in your tenant. \n",

    "### Managed Private Endpoints for Microsoft Fabric\n",
    "----------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "We are excited to announce the public preview of Managed Private Endpoints for Microsoft Fabric. This feature allows secure connections to data sources that are behind a firewall or not accessible from the public internet. Managed Private Endpoints enable Fabric Data Engineering items to access data sources securely without exposing them to the public network or requiring complex network configurations. These private endpoints provide a secure way to connect and access data from sources like Azure SQL DB or Storage account blocked from public access from your Fabric Spark Notebooks or Spark Job Definitions. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Image 27: A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](https://dataplatformblogcdn.azureedge.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/a-screenshot-of-a-computer-description-automatica-57.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Workspaces with managed private endpoints have network isolation through a dedicated managed virtual network. These managed virtual networks (Managed VNETs) separate the Spark compute clusters from the shared virtual network and enable network security features such as private links and managed private endpoints. Microsoft Fabric takes care of the provisioning and management of the virtual networks and private endpoints, so users do not have to create or manage these network infrastructure resources themselves. \n",
    "\n",
    "By just providing connection details, your managed private endpoint is instantly provisioned in the Managed VNET and a request for private endpoint access is submitted to the data source administrator for approval.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Users can track the status and approval process of the managed private endpoints from the Network security section of the Workspace settings. \n",
    "\n",

    "### Trusted Workspace Access for OneLake Shortcuts \n",
    "-----------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Trusted workspace access allows you to securely access firewall-enabled Storage accounts. With Trusted workspace access, you can create [OneLake shortcuts](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/onelake/onelake-shortcuts) to Storage accounts, and then use the shortcuts in various Fabric items, such as Spark notebooks, SQL analytics endpoints, semantic models, reports, data pipelines, and dataflows Gen2.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Trusted workspace access is designed to help you securely and easily access data stored in Storage accounts from Fabric workspaces, without compromising on performance or functionality. You can leverage the power and flexibility of Fabric and OneLake to work with data in place without compromising on security. \n",
    "\n",
    "**How does Trusted workspace access work?** \n",
    "\n",
    "Trusted workspace access is based on the concept of workspace identity, which is a unique identity that can be associated with workspaces that are in Fabric capacities. When you create a workspace identity, Fabric creates a service principal in Microsoft Entra ID to represent the identity.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Workspace identity enables OneLake shortcuts in Fabric to access Storage accounts that have resource instance rules configured. Resource instance rules are a way to grant access to specific resources based on the workspace identity or managed identity. You can create resource instance rules by deploying an ARM template with the resource instance rule details.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To leverage Trusted workspace access in Fabric workspaces, you can create a OneLake shortcut in a Lakehouse, and provide the URL of the Storage account that has been configured with a resource instance rule. While creating the shortcut, you need to select organizational account or service principle for authentication and ensure that the principle used for authenticating to Storage has the appropriate Azure RBAC roles on the Storage account. Once the shortcut is created, you can use it in various Fabric items. \n",
    "\n",
    "**How to get started with Trusted workspace access?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Trusted workspace access is available for workspaces in Fabric capacities (F64 or higher). To get started with Trusted workspace access, you need to do the following steps:  \n",

This feature aims to reduce the frequency of throttling errors (HTTP 430: Spark Capacity Limit Exceeded Response) and improve the job admission experience for our customers, especially during peak usage hours.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Throttling errors on Spark workload occur when the Spark usage exceeds the Fabric capacity limits. In the current job admission policy, Fabric Spark reserves the maximum number of cores that a job may need during its execution, based on the maximum number of nodes that the job can scale up to. This ensures that the job will always have enough resources to run, but it also limits the number of concurrent jobs that can be admitted in the cluster. \n",
    "\n",
    "With Optimistic Job Admission, Fabric Spark only reserves the minimum number of cores that a job needs to start, based on the minimum number of nodes that the job can scale down to. This allows more jobs to be admitted if there are enough resources to meet the minimum requirements. If a job needs to scale up later, the scale up requests are approved or rejected based on the available cores in capacity.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Optimistic Job Admission can significantly increase the max number of concurrent jobs for our customers, especially for those who use large SKUs. For example, if a customer is using F32 SKU, which has 64 Spark VCores (Based on 1 CU = 2 Spark VCores) and 192 Max Burst Cores for concurrency (based on the 3X burst multiplier), they can only run 3 jobs concurrently in the current job admission policy, assuming they have the default starter pool configuration. \n",
